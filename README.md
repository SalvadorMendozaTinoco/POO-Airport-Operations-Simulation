# Airport Operations Simulation
This project addresses the critical challenge of managing airport congestion at Mexico City International Airport (AICM) through an object-oriented simulation system developed in C++. Given the increasing pressure on the airport's capacity, this solution models flight scheduling and passenger flow to optimize operations, particularly during peak hours.

## Project Complexity
The project is designed with a high level of complexity, incorporating advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to accurately represent the various entities and processes within the airport environment. The system leverages core OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to create a modular and scalable architecture. Additionally, the application of Unified Modeling Language (UML) was essential in the planning and documentation phases. Detailed class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and use case models were developed to guide the implementation and ensure a robust design.

## Key Features
Object-Oriented Design: The system is built using OOP principles to model real-world entities such as flights, passengers, and airport resources, enabling flexible and maintainable code.

UML Documentation: UML was employed to map out the structure and behavior of the system, providing clear visual representations of the system's architecture and interactions.

Data Management: Although the public repository only includes the C++ codebase, SQL was utilized for managing data within the simulation, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of information.

Scalability: The system is designed to be scalable, accommodating the dynamic nature of airport operations, and can be easily extended to include additional features or adapt to different airport scenarios.
